# Property Decorators (@property)

# class Circle:
#     def __init__(self, radius):
#         self._radius = radius

#     @property
#     @staticmethod  # this wont working 
#     def radius(self):
#         return self._radius

#     @property
#     def area(self):
#         return 3.14 * (self._radius ** 2)

# c = Circle(5)
# print(c.radius)  # 5
# print(Circle.radius)   # this wont working
# print(c.area)    # 78.5

# 
# @property.setter
# 

# When you want to set or update the value of a property, you can control how it‚Äôs done using @property.setter.
# It helps you validate the new value or trigger some logic when someone tries to change it.

# class Circle:
#     def __init__(self, radius):
#         self._radius = radius
        
#     @property
#     def radius(self):
#         return self._radius
    
#     # @property
#     @radius.setter
#     def radius(self, new_radius):
#         if new_radius > 0:
#             self._radius = new_radius
#         else:
#             print("did you saw any negative radius in your life ??")
    
#     @property
#     def area(self):
#         return 3.14 * (self._radius ** 2)
    
    
    
    
# c = Circle(5)
# print(c.radius)     # 5
# print(c.area)       # 78.5
    
    
# c.radius = 10  # changing radius
# print(c.radius)     #10
# print(c.area)       #314.0

# c.radius = -5


# When you see self._radius (with underscore _ in front),
# it means:
# ‚û°Ô∏è "This is a private or internal variable. Please don't touch it directly from outside the class."

# ‚úÖ Why we need _radius and not radius ?

# self.radius = new_radius

# inside the setter,
# then the setter will call itself again! (and again, and again... üî•üî• infinite loop!)

# ‚û°Ô∏è You are trying to set radius, but radius itself is managed by the setter.
# It will keep calling itself forever ‚û°Ô∏è crash!

# 7. Decorators
# 

# Decorators are like "functions that modify other functions" without changing their original code.
# (Think of it like putting a filter on a photo üì∏ ‚Äî original photo stays same, but new look!)



# def decorator_function(orginal_function):
#     def wrapper_function():
#         print("wrapper executed before", orginal_function.__name__)
#         print("Before the function is called.")
#         orginal_function()
#         print("After the function is called.")
#     return wrapper_function


# @decorator_function
# def say_hello():
#     print("hellow next adorable person")
    
    
# say_hello()

# üí• Another Example: Timing a Function

# import time

# def timer_decorator(func):
#     def wrapper():
#         start = time.time()
#         func()
#         end = time.time()
#         print(f"Excution time: {end - start} seconds")
#     return wrapper

# @timer_decorator
# def slow_function():
#     time.sleep(2)
#     print("slow function finished.")
    


# slow_function()



# def decorator_function(original_function):
#     def wrapper_function():
#         print("Before the function is called.")
#         original_function()
#         print("After the function is called.")
#     return wrapper_function

# @decorator_function
# def say_hello():
#     print("Hello, world!")

# say_hello()
