# üìñ 1. "r" ‚Äî Read Mode
# Only reading, no writing!

# with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
#     content = file.read()
#     print(content)
    
    
#     # If the file doesn‚Äôt exist, it gives an error.

# # You cannot write anything in this mode.


# ‚úçüèª 2. "w" ‚Äî Write Mode
# Write new data ‚Äî BUT be careful, it deletes old content!

# with open("sample.txt", "w") as file:
#     file.write("Hellow, this is new data !!!")
    
# # If file exists ‚Üí erase everything inside first.

# # If file doesn't exist ‚Üí create new file.


# ‚ûï 3. "a" ‚Äî Append Mode
# Safely add new content to bottom, without deleting anything.

# with open("sample.txt", "a") as file:
#     file.write("\nAnother line added")

# Useful for logs, notes, saving user data, etc.

#  4. "r+" ‚Äî Read and Write Mode
# Read old content + also modify/write if needed.

# with open("sample.txt", "r+") as file:
#     file.write("\nAddidng new line after reading!!!.")
#     content = file.read()
#     print(content)


# file = open("sample.txt", "r")
# content = file.read()
# print(content)
# file.close()

# Normally, when we open a file, we should always close it manually after finishing.
# Example without with:

# if you forget file.close(), the file stays open in memory üò¨ ‚Üí can cause memory leak or file locking issues.

# ‚úÖ But when you use with open,
# Python automatically closes the file when you exit the block!
