# What is a Class?
# A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. It defines:

# What data the object should have (attributes)

# What it can do (methods)


# ðŸ”¹ What is an Object?
# An object is an instance of a class â€” like how you can create many cars (objects) from one car blueprint (class).
